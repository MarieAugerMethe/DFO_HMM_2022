# Hidden Markov Models: Missing data and multiple data streams

## objectives

-   Dealing irregular locations,

-   time gaps,

-   including diving covariates

-   narwhal data

# import data
First, we'll setup the workspace with required packages
```{r message=FALSE}
library(momentuHMM)
```

```{r message=FALSE}
read.csv()
```

# visualise data

# assess data structure (resolution/gaps)

# brainstorm methods to merge data streams (same resolution, hierarchical)

# brainstorm methods to select resolution

# brainstorm methods to fill missing data (NA, linear interpolation, imputation, multiple imputation, track segmentation)

# basic HMM (only locs)

# brainstorm HMM development (dive-only HMM, or add dives to locs, covariates to add; covs to TPM & DS (eg angle bias))

# setup tutorial development issue thread
